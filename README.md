Quick Response (QR) codes are created as machine readable symbols, which are used in different aspects of life due to its excellent message capacity and quick decoding speed. QR code is frequently used in many fields including e-commerce, advertising, product tracing, mobile payments, warehousing and logistics (Huang et. al, 2020). Security is one of the major problems that QR code is facing. Recent studies indicate that barcodes can be maliciously used for performing numerous kinds of attacks, including phishing, reader application attacks, malware propagation, cross-site scripting (XXS) and attacks using SQL or command injection. In , the proponents aim to design and develop a mobile application that would prevent QR phishing. For the development of the project, tools such as Ionic framework, and Angular are used.


## What the project does
The primary objective of the project is to prevent QR code phishing attacks using URL-based and content-based features. Specifically, the URL encoded in the QR code is checked by different phishing URL rules. It will give a response to the user telling him if the URL is safe or not. These rules were gathered by analyzing related literature on preventing phishing attacks from electronic databases. Moreover, the generation of QR codes is another function of the project. The QR code can be saved in the application or downloaded to local storage. Furthermore, it also has a scanning history that shows the scanning log of the user.

## How to install
Step 1: Download the installer for Node LTS.   
    
Step 2: Install the ionic CLI globally: ```npm install -g ionic```.   
    
Step 3: Install ```npm i angularx-qrcode```.    
    
Step 3: Clone repository:.    
   
Step 4: Run ```npm install from the project root```.    
    
Step 5: Run ```ionic serve``` in a terminal from project root.
